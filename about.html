                        My college academics began with two years at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. From the fall of 2012 to the fall of 2014, I went to both the Harrison County and the Jackson County Campuses. While attending, I persued (but did not attain) a Bachelor of Science.

                In the summer of 2018, while still at USM, I had the unique opprotunity to do a three month internship at
                <strong>NASA John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi</strong> as a result of an instructors recommendation.
                The internship project 
                
                specifically dealt with helping the National Data Buoy Center
                and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's main operations for gathering weather data 
                for the public use. Here, I gained my first real world software development experience and what it would be like 
                to work in the industry
                <br>
                <br>
                by creating a database back end
                using MariaDB and testing it using the Eclipse IDE for the Java Programming language.
                In addition, I also created supporting charts and graphs of bouy coordinates using MATLAB.

                <img src = "NOAA.png" alt = "NASA" class = "AboutMePictures"/>
                In my last week, I gave a presentation in front of the NDBC staff where I demonstrated some of the database functionalities 
                along with all supporting front end test code and any other graphs, or charts which I had produced.

                In November of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                I managed to secure a fully remote (and then hybrid) full time software development position in Metairie, Louisiana, 
                with a federal government contracting company based in Juneau, Alaska called Goldbelt Inc. 
                While employed with Goldbelt (and its subsidiary - Goldbelt Nighthawk), I worked on a personell management software 
                called My Navy Assignment- as part of a continuing contract for the United States Navy.
